        Online Shopping is the activity or action of buying products or services
        over the Internet. It means going online, landing on a seller’s website,
        selecting something, and arranging for its delivery. The buyer either
        pays for the good or service online with a credit or debit card or upon
        delivery.<br><br>

        In this article, the term ‘online’ means ‘on the Internet.’
        The term does not only include buying things online but also
        searching for them online. In other words, I may have been engaged
        in online shopping but did not buy anything.<br><br>

        Online shopping has been around for about twenty-five years. It has
        grown in popularity significantly.
        Today, we can purchase nearly anything online. In fact, retail experts
        say that online shopping will soon overtake traditional shopping in
        monetary terms.<br><br>

        Online shopping is part of E-Commerce, which stands for Electronic
        Commerce.<br><br>

        Online Shopping occurs when a customer buys through a digital
        platform. An example of such a platform is Bikerringshop.com,online
        biker ring store from Thailand. You don’t have to live in this country
        to get one of the products this store sells. Global coverage is one of
        the major benefits of online shopping.<br><br>

        Online shopping can reduce the carbon footprint associated with
        retail by decreasing the number of trips consumers make to physical
        stores.<br><br>

        For example, Amazon.com sells nearly all of its goods online through
        its e-commerce platform.<br><br>

        NewEgg, Ocado, and TigerDirect also focus primarily on online
        shopping facilities.<br><br>
